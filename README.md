# Asteroid_Data
This application is built to check the asteroid data from the official **NASA API**. This is built using the react js and axios for the api fetch requests.
You can select the time period and when you submit the dates the asteroid data between those dates will appear and when clicked on the Asteroid card it shows you the complete table of time lines of the asteroid's closest approach.
